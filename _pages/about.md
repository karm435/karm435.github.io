## About Receiptly
Karma Academy owns ‘Receiptly’, an app which helps users category and search for receipts, invoices, sales slips, gift cards, and vouchers and keep a record of their shopping history. The app uses optical character recognition (OCR) to convert images into text. It is designed for in-store shopping and saving the hassle of finding receipts. In addition, it gives users freedom from physical copies while maintaining user data privacy.
