## About the developer
I’m Karmjit Singh, an iOS developer living in Brisbane Australia. Besides coding, I like to play badminton and gardening.

Receiptly is my first and most fully-featured app. A couple of years ago, I was at the category and I needed to find my receipt for that category and I could not. I looked for some apps in the Appcategory to manage receipts but they were not fulfilling all my needs like group by category, tags, and search and warranties. 
I decided to build my own app.It has been an amazing journey and I am still working on great features for this app. but I think it’s gotten to be pretty useful for stuff beyond that. But anyway, I’m very committed to user privacy. No one likes apps that sell your data. My app don’t collect data, and have pro features for pro users who want to do more that just saving and searching of receipts.
